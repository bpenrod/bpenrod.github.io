> 1st Gent. Where lies the power, there let the blame lie too. \\
 \\
 2d Gent.  Nay, power is relative; you cannot fright \\
 The coming pest with border fortresses,\\
 Or catch your carp with subtle argument.\\
 All force is twain in one:  cause is not cause\\
 Unless effect be there; and action's self\\
 Must needs contain a passive.  So command\\
 Exists but with obedience.\\
